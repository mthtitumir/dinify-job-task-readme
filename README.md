# Dinify Software Engineer Task 
## 1. Understanding of the business
Dinify is Dinify is a Canadian food service platform that helps restaurants and food trucks get orders to customers faster and run more efficiently. It does this with two parts:

A customer app that lets people look at menus, order food, and pay with their phone.
A restaurant dashboard that helps owners and staff manage orders, change menus, and plan where people sit.
Dinify's platform makes it easier for restaurants and food trucks to:

Get orders to customers faster
Run more efficiently
Make fewer mistakes
Give customers a better experience
Dinify is unique because it helps both customers and restaurants. It is also helping restaurants and food trucks in Canada use technology better.

In short, Dinify is a technology company that is making the Canadian food service industry better for everyone.

## 2. UI Fixes
### Client Side
- Make the order button more prominent. The order button is currently quite small and tucked away in the corner of the page. It would be more effective if it were larger and placed in a more central location.
- Add a progress bar to the checkout process. This would help customers to see how far they are along in the checkout process and how much longer it will take them to complete it.
- Allow customers to edit their orders. Currently, customers are not able to edit their orders once they have been placed. This can be frustrating if they make a mistake or change their mind. Allowing customers to edit their orders would make the checkout process more user-friendly.
- Add a payment confirmation page. Once a customer has completed their order, it would be helpful to show them a confirmation page that summarizes their order and provides them with a payment receipt. This would give customers peace of mind knowing that their order has been placed successfully.

In addition to these specific fixes, there are a few general UI/UX improvements that I would suggest:

- Use more whitespace. The website currently feels quite cluttered and overwhelming. Adding more whitespace would make the website feel more spacious and easier to navigate.
- Use larger fonts. The fonts used on the website are currently quite small. Using larger fonts would make the website more accessible to users with visual impairments and would also make it easier to read on mobile devices.
- Improve the contrast between text and background colors. The contrast between the text and background colors on the website is currently not very high. This can make it difficult to read the text, especially for users with visual impairments. Increasing the contrast between the text and background colors would make the website more accessible and easier to read for everyone.

### Restaurant dashboard
#### Manage Menu

- Make the menu items easier to edit and update. Currently, it is a bit cumbersome to add, remove, or change the order of menu items.
- Add the ability to preview changes to the menu before they are published. This would help to ensure that the menu is accurate and looks the way you want it to look before it goes live.
- Add the ability to create and manage multiple menus. This would be useful for businesses that have different menus for different occasions (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, catering).
- Add the ability to schedule menu changes to go into effect at a specific time or date. This would be useful for businesses that change their menu on a regular basis (e.g., daily, weekly, seasonally).

#### Orders Page

- Make the order list easier to filter and sort. Currently, it is difficult to find specific orders in the list.
- Add the ability to view and manage order details in a single view. Currently, users have to click on each order to view its details.
- Add the ability to export order data to a CSV or other format. This would be useful for businesses that need to track their orders outside of the Dinify platform.
- Add the ability to cancel orders. Currently, users are unable to cancel orders once they have been placed. This can be frustrating for customers if they make a mistake or change their mind. Allowing users to cancel orders would make the ordering process more user-friendly.

## 3. My First UI Fixes


The first thing I would do to fix the UI problems on the Manage Menu and Orders Page is to make the menu items easier to edit and update. Currently, it is a bit cumbersome to add, remove, or change the order of menu items. This is a relatively easy fix that would make a big difference in the usability of the page.

Here are a few specific suggestions for how to make the menu items easier to edit and update:

- Add inline editing. This would allow users to edit menu items directly on the page, without having to open a separate dialog box.
- Add drag-and-drop functionality. This would allow users to easily change the order of menu items by dragging and dropping them to the desired location.
- Add a bulk edit option. This would allow users to make changes to multiple menu items at once.

Once I have made the menu items easier to edit and update, I would move on to addressing the other UI problems on the page. I would focus on making the order list easier to filter and sort, improving the ability to view and manage order details, and adding the ability to export order data.
